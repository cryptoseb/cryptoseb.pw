# cryptoseb.pw | Website Files
I created this website back in 2015 (I think) using Adobe Muse. Now, Muse has longsince been lost as a program that is not maintained or cared about anymore, so there's a potential of some security holes here. Feel free to fix them for me and send me the updated versions, haha. I went and updated this site sometime in 2019, I think, but really haven't touched it since. I'll update it sometime down the road once this tech-journey becomes more extensive.

## Some More Information:

- Some of the files, like: /mail and /wp-login.php were created as a joke for anyone trying to sniff out directories.

- I used to be big on verifying everything with my PGP key, but really don't see why. I haven't kept this current in quite some time. I'm actually scared to go look in /verified.html and see all of the outdated contact methods.

- There also appears to be a few PGP keys in here. One of them is probably my backup key, one of them my primary key, and one of them my ProtonMail key for the email root@cryptoseb.pw

- The /404.html page isn't particularly "friendly", but at the time, I was getting a lot of people snooping around and attempting to takeover my server. I have zero clue why, there's never been anything of value on this server that wasn't first encrypted. Oh well, I'll change that file sometime I'm sure.
