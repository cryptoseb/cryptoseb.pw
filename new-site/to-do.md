# Things To Do:

- Fix margins on mobile device
- Edit the list styling on about page so it isn't ugly
- Edit the menu so that it shows the active page properly
- Ensure that the site is mobile-ready
- Add more 'things to do'

SOOOO.... I started using freeCodeCamp and have realized that you can style elements with more than one class. So I probably didn't need to split up my stylesheet into so many classes. Food for thought down the road.
