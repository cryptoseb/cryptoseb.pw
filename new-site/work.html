<p>I just left an extensive career in Early Learning and Childcare to persue tech full time. Here's a more in-depth look at the tech side of this journey.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Privacy & Security Work</h3>
  <p>Started learning about privacy and security online in the middle of 2012 and was really drawn to it. This learning evolved exponentially, and in 2016 I <a href="https://github.com/cryptoseb/cryptopaper">wrote a 58-page paper</a> involving privacy, security, and anonymity. It was downloaded over 3000 times before I moved it to GitHub and the project became stale. More recently, I wrote a paper for my group of Child Passenger Safety Technicians after one of our members got hit with a Sim Jacking Attack. You can <a href="https://cryptoseb.pw/account_takeover_draft_v0.1.pd">read that here.</a></p>
  <br>
  <h3>Systems Administration</h3>
  <p>Around the same time that I wrote the Crypto | Paper, I started learning server administration and uploaded a new version of my portfolio onto a VPS running Debian. I now know my way around Debian, but do admit to having to Google and fiddle when big issues arise. I can set up a web server running NGINX and MySQL with <a href="https://github.com/cryptoseb/le-autorun">solid TLS/SSL cert deployment</a> fairly quickly now. I'd like to learn more about SQL Databases, and continue learning about Docker so that EasyEngine isn't such a pain to navigate.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Website Design</h3>
  <p>My journey into website design started with webs dot com (I know, I know), branched off into Adobe Muse (I KNOW, I KNOW), and has finally landed on WordPress with front-end builders. Because I was so passionate about my work in childcare, I didn't really focus on this aspect of my tech hobby. However, that has changed recently and I have some awesome projects on the books. Here's 3 websites I have built from the ground up:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://alloutdrilling.ca">All Out Water Well Services & Drilling LTD.</a></li><br>
      <li><a href="https://saskseats.ca">SaskSeats - Child Passenger Safety</a></li><br>
      <li><a href="https://summitmeats.com">Summit Meats & Sausage LTD.</a></li>
    </ul></p>
  <br>
  <h3>Digital Management</h3>
  <p> I enjoy "doing it all" when it comes to working for a company digitally. I like designing their website, and challenging myself to get them ranked high on Google, and setting up Search Console, and Analytics, and their email, and helping run their Facebook/Google accounts, and creating flyers/brochures in Photoshop, and just generally driving their business up from a digital stance. This is what I have done for both <em>All Out Drilling</em> and <em>Summit Meats</em> and it has been great going from not knowing really anything, to figuring it all out so that they can hold a successful online position in their respective industries. I'm still learning, but I'm committed to my work.</p>
